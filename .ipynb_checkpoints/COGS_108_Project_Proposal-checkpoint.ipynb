    "1. Based on looking into Yelp reviews for multiple chain restaurants on Yelp, we noticed that some chains were rated higher than other brances of those same chains based on location. One interesting thing we saw was slightly different ratings that were based on certain aspects of the location such as proximity to a university and average income in the area among others. For example, Burger King's reviews for their mutliple locations in San Diego:\n",
